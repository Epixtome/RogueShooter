# RogueShooter
Used a tutorial to create this code. Playable game available at itch.io (see readme)

This is the first installation of the Rogue Shooter that I have put on github. The tutorial is from Games by James on Udemy. His Rogue-like dungeon shooter tutorial is 20 hours long. I completed more thna 50% of the tutorial three times to get a better understanding of what I was doing. I had made modifications to the game along the way. I kept rigidbodies on boxes so you can use them as cover when playing. Spikes were solid and could not be rolled over. Enemies were slightly more expressive.

My third time through the tutorial, I completed over 85% of it at 1.5x speed with little to no pause time to correct errors. By the end of the tutorial, James gets kind of tired or annoyed at his game, and so did I. After the 15 hour mark, a lot of the content added seems to be less planned out and odd. This is why I never completed the character sprite switching mechanism.
